# Abstract

The blockchain trilemma, which posits that distributed ledger systems can achieve at most two of three critical properties—scalability, security, and decentralization—has persisted as a fundamental constraint in blockchain design since its articulation in 2014. This thesis investigates whether modern consensus protocols have resolved this trilemma through algorithmic innovation and engineering advancement, with particular emphasis on the role of energy efficiency as a fourth evaluation dimension.

This research introduces the Trilemma Evaluation Framework 2025 (TEF-2025), a novel quantitative methodology for systematic consensus protocol assessment across four pillars: scalability, security, decentralization, and energy efficiency. The framework employs standardized normalization functions and a weighted geometric mean aggregation to compute the Trilemma Balance Index (TBI), providing the first rigorous mathematical approach to trilemma quantification. The TEF-2025 framework addresses critical gaps in existing evaluation methodologies by integrating energy considerations and establishing standardized comparison metrics.

Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, six representative consensus protocols spanning major protocol families were systematically assessed: CometBFT (BFT-PoS), IBFT-Besu (PoA), HotStuff (optimized BFT), DPoS (delegated consensus), DAG (directed acyclic graph), and PoW (traditional proof-of-work). The experimental methodology combined controlled testbed implementations for CometBFT and IBFT-Besu with validated literature data for remaining protocols, ensuring comprehensive coverage while maintaining measurement consistency through statistical validation and cross-referencing.

The results provide definitive evidence that the blockchain trilemma can be substantially resolved through modern consensus design. Five of six evaluated protocols achieved TBI scores exceeding 0.70, with HotStuff demonstrating optimal balance (TBI = 0.809) across all evaluation dimensions. The analysis reveals an 80-fold energy efficiency gap between traditional PoW systems (0.8 Wh/tx) and modern protocols (0.01-0.04 Wh/tx), establishing energy efficiency as a decisive factor in consensus protocol selection. Contemporary BFT-PoS protocols demonstrate that high security, reasonable decentralization, and excellent energy efficiency can be achieved simultaneously while maintaining throughput levels 100-1000 times greater than PoW systems.

The findings challenge conventional assumptions about trilemma constraints and demonstrate that appropriate protocol selection enables balanced performance across all four evaluation pillars. DAG protocols excel in scalability and energy efficiency (TBI = 0.772), BFT-PoS implementations achieve optimal overall balance, while traditional PoW systems exhibit fundamental limitations (TBI = 0.372) that render them unsuitable for most contemporary applications requiring high performance and sustainability.

This research makes significant theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions to blockchain consensus evaluation. The TEF-2025 framework provides a standardized foundation for protocol comparison that accommodates emerging technologies and changing requirements. The empirical demonstration of trilemma resolution offers evidence-based guidance for protocol selection across diverse application domains, from high-security financial systems to high-throughput payment networks. The integration of energy efficiency considerations addresses critical sustainability concerns while revealing new optimization opportunities for consensus protocol development.

The implications extend beyond academic research to practical deployment guidance, offering quantitative decision-making support for organizations selecting consensus mechanisms. The research establishes that the blockchain trilemma, rather than representing an insurmountable technical barrier, defines a design space that can be navigated successfully through appropriate algorithmic choices and engineering optimization. This finding opens new possibilities for blockchain technology adoption across industries previously constrained by perceived trilemma limitations.
