# Chapter 5 Figures Summary

## Successfully Updated Figures with GitHub-Compatible Links

All ASCII art diagrams in Chapter 5 have been replaced with actual generated visualizations. Here are the updated figures:

### Generated Chapter 5 Figures

1. **Figure 5.1: Data Source Classification**
   - File: `./outputs/data_source_classification.png`
   - Shows reliability vs environment type matrix for different protocols

2. **Figure 5.2: Protocol Performance Radar Chart**
   - File: `./outputs/protocol_performance_radar.png`
   - TEF-2025 four-pillar radar chart showing all protocols

3. **Figure 5.3: Performance Distribution by Protocol Family**
   - File: `./outputs/performance_distribution.png`
   - TBI score distribution across protocol families

4. **Figure 5.4: Pillar Trade-off Analysis**
   - File: `./outputs/pillar_tradeoff_analysis.png`
   - Four subplot analysis of pillar relationships

5. **Figure 5.5: Energy Efficiency Comparison**
   - File: `./outputs/energy_efficiency_comparison.png`
   - Energy consumption and carbon footprint comparison

6. **Figure 5.6: Committee Safety Risk Curves**
   - File: `./outputs/committee_safety_curves.png`
   - Safety risk vs committee size for different adversary strengths

7. **Figure 5.7: Bootstrap Analysis Results**
   - File: `./outputs/bootstrap_analysis.png`
   - Statistical validation with confidence intervals

8. **Figure 5.8: Trilemma Resolution Evidence**
   - File: `./outputs/trilemma_resolution.png`
   - Traditional trilemma vs TEF-2025 results comparison

### Additional Available Figures

These figures were generated earlier and can be used in other chapters:

9. **Radar Chart (Alternative)**
   - File: `./outputs/radar_protocols.png`
   - Alternative radar visualization

10. **Scatter Plot: TPS vs Finality**
    - File: `./outputs/scatter_tps_finality.png`
    - Throughput vs finality time analysis

11. **Safety Curves (Alternative)**
    - File: `./outputs/safety_curves.png`
    - Alternative safety analysis visualization

## GitHub Markdown Compatibility

All figures use relative paths (`./outputs/filename.png`) which will render correctly in:
- GitHub repository viewing
- Local Markdown editors
- VS Code Markdown preview
- Documentation websites

## Image Quality

All images are generated with:
- 300 DPI for publication quality
- Professional styling and colors
- Clear labels and legends
- Proper sizing for thesis inclusion

## Usage in Thesis

These figures provide comprehensive visual support for:
- Empirical results presentation
- Performance comparison analysis
- Statistical validation evidence
- Trilemma resolution demonstration

The thesis now contains professional publication-quality figures instead of ASCII art, suitable for academic submission and GitHub documentation display.
