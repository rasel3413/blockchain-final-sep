The empirical results demonstrate that modern consensus protocols have achieved remarkable progress, with several protocols delivering strong performance across all four evaluation pillars. This success challenges the notion of an intractable trilemma and opens new possibilities for blockchain applications in financial services, supply chain management, healthcare, and beyond.

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the TEF-2025 framework provides a stable foundation for evaluating innovations and guiding the development of next-generation consensus protocols. The future of blockchain consensus lies not in choosing between scalability, security, decentralization, and energy efficiency, but in optimizing all four dimensions simultaneously.
