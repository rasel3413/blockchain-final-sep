# Chapter 4: Methodology

## 4.1 Research Design and Approach

This investigation employs a sophisticated mixed-methods approach that integrates theoretical framework development with comprehensive empirical evaluation to systematically examine trilemma resolution in contemporary blockchain consensus protocols. The research methodology emerged from extensive pilot studies conducted between January and March 2024, during which preliminary experiments revealed significant measurement challenges that informed the final methodological approach.

### 4.1.1 Research Philosophy and Paradigmatic Foundation

The research adopts a **post-positivist empirical approach** grounded in quantitative methodologies while acknowledging the inherent complexity of distributed systems evaluation. During the conceptual development phase, the author recognized that traditional reductionist approaches were insufficient for capturing the multifaceted nature of consensus protocol performance. This paradigm emphasizes:

- **Objective Measurement Protocols**: Standardized metrics and experimental procedures designed to ensure reproducibility across diverse research environments
- **Quantitative Analytical Framework**: Mathematical methodologies for consensus protocol comparison that provide statistically robust conclusions
- **Empirical Validation Methodology**: Experimental evidence systematically collected to support theoretical propositions
- **Systematic Procedural Rigor**: Carefully designed procedures to minimize investigator bias and ensure result reliability

The philosophical foundation emerged from the author's recognition during preliminary research that existing evaluation approaches lacked the systematic rigor necessary for definitive trilemma resolution assessment.

### 4.1.2 Research Strategy

The investigation follows a **sequential explanatory strategy** consisting of three phases:

**Phase 1: Framework Development** - Creation of the TEF-2025 evaluation framework and TBI methodology based on theoretical foundations and literature analysis.

**Phase 3: Analysis and Validation** - Statistical analysis of results, framework validation, and synthesis of findings to answer the research questions.

### 4.1.3 Protocol Selection Criteria
